# ContentCarousel #

## About ##
This OSX application will display videos and images full screen on any display. It works by looking in a 'watch' folder (set in `~/Library/Preferences/io.oxygn.ContentCarousel.plist`), and displays the videos and images one after another, in alphabetical order. It can be useful for corporate events when images and videos need to be shown on a loop for long periods of time. The content in the watch folder can be updated, without the 'carousel' ceasing to show content, and has been tested with mounted network volumes.
